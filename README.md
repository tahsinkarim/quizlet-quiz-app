# ABOUT

- A Front-end quiz app that lets you test you knowledge on front-end technologies.

# Steps

- I used vite to create a react app instead of `npm create-react-app` since its faster.
- For styling I used Tailwind CSS. It really helps with not writing unnecessary CSS.
- For routing I used React Router and `npm install react-toastify` to generate dynamic toasts.

# Features

- Generates dynamic routes and pages for each quiz.
- Notifies with toast when clicked on answers.
- Eye button to reveal correct answer with toast.
- Keeps count of correct and wrong answer.
- A statistic page to display a chart of total number of questions for each quiz.
